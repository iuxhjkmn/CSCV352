/*EXERCISE5_1
WRITE A FILE CASE CONVERSION PROGRAM THAT ACCEPTS THE NAME OF TWO FILES AS COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS. 
THE FIRST PARAMETER IS THE SOURCE FILE, AND THE SECOND PARAMETER IS THE OUTPUT FILE. 
THE PROGRAM CONVERTS THE SOURCE FILE TO UPPER CASE BY READING THE TEXT FROM THE SOURCE FILE, 
CONVERTING THE CHARACTERS TO UPPER CASE, AND WRITING THE CONVERTED TEXT TO THE OUTPUT FILE. 
USE THE TOUPPER() FUNCTION FROM CTYPE.H FOR CASE CONVERSION. OPEN BOTH THE INPUT FILE AND THE OUTPUT 
FILE IN TEXT MODE USING FOPEN(). MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE RETURN VALUE FROM FOPEN(). IF ONE OR THE OTHER 
FILE DOES NOT OPEN, THE PROGRAM MUST PRINT A MESSAGE TO THE CONSOLE AND EXIT.
THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE USED AS FOLLOWS:
        ./EXERCISE5_1 <SOURCE_FILE> <OUTPUT_FILE>
TAKE A SCREENSHOT SHOWING THE TERMINAL AFTER THE PROGRAM RUNS. THE SCREENSHOT SHOULD SHOW THE OUTPUT OF YOUR 
PROGRAM. NAME THE SCREENSHOT EITHER EXERCISE5_1.JPG OR EXERCISE5_1.PNG, DEPENDING ON THE IMAGE TYPE OF THE 
SCREENSHOT FILE.
WHEN COMPLETE, TURN IN YOUR SOURCE CODE FILE USING THE FILENAME EXERCISE5_1.C 
AND YOUR SCREENSHOT FILE NAMED ACCORDING TO THE ABOVE INSTRUCTION.
