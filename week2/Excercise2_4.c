/*Exercise2_4
Write a program that creates two seven-element arrays of type double and uses a loop to let the user enter values for each of 
the seven elements of the first array.
Have the program set the elements of the second array to the cumulative totals of the elements of the first array. For example, 
the fourth element of the second array should equal the sum of the first four elements of the first array, and the fifth element of
the second array should equal the sum of the first five elements of the first array. (Itâ€™s possible to do this with either nested or 
multiple loops, but by using the fact that the fifth element of the second array equals the fourth element of the second array plus 
the fifth element of the first array, you can avoid multiple loops and just use a single loop for this task.)
Finally, use two loops to display the contents of the two arrays, with the first array displayed on one line and with each element of
the second array displayed below the corresponding element of the first array.
Turn your program in as Exercise2_4.c.
