/* 
Exercise3_5
Write a program that reads characters from the standard input to end-of-file. 
For each character read, have the program print the ASCII value of the character in hexadecimal form and report whether or not the character is a letter. 
If it is a letter, also report its numerical location in the alphabet. For example, c and C would both be letter 3. 
Your implementation must incorporate a function that takes a character as an argument and returns the numerical location 
in the alphabet if the character is a letter or returns â€“1 if the character is not a letter.
Take a screenshot showing the terminal after the program runs. The screenshot should show the output of your program. 
Name the screenshot either Exercise3_5.jpg or Exercise3_5.png, depending on the image type of the screenshot file.
When complete, turn in your source code file using the filename Exercise3_5.c and your screenshot file named according to the above instruction.
