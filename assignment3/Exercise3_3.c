/* 
Exercise3_3
Write a program that reads data from standard input as a stream of characters until the program encounters the End-of-File or EOF. 
The program then reports the average number of letters per word from the data that was read. Donâ€™t include whitespaces in calculations for word 
length.Test the program by piping the contents of the provided Exercise3_3.txt file as input into your program.
Take a screenshot showing the terminal after the program runs with the test file. The screenshot should show the output of your program. 
Name the screenshot either Exercise3_3.jpg or Exercise3_3.png, depending on the image type of the screenshot file.
When complete, turn in your source code file using the filename Exercise3_3.c and your screenshot file named according to the above instruction.
